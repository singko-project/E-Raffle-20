  <h2>REFERRAL PROGRAM</h2>

  <strong>ADDITIONAL BONUS RAFFLE ENTRIES</strong><br>
  For every successful referral you bring into E-Raffle-20, you receive <strong>1 extra raffle entry</strong>.<br>
  •	These entries are <strong>added automatically</strong> to your account once the referral joins and is verified.<br>
  •	There is <strong>no limit</strong> to how many bonus entries you can earn — the more people you refer, the higher your chances of winning.<br>
  •	Bonus raffle entries <strong>stack on top of your initial raffle entry</strong>, giving you an advantage without any additional cost.<br>
  •	This system ensures that all participants have a <strong>fair and transparent opportunity</strong> to win.<br><br>
  <strong>REFERRAL BONUS</strong><br>
  As part of the Referral Program, each successful participant you bring in earns you a <strong>₱10 referral bonus</strong>.<br>
  •	The Referral bonus is <strong>automatically processed</strong> once the system detects your referral and will be <strong>sent directly to your e-wallet</strong>.<br>
  •	There is <strong>no limit</strong> to how many referral bonuses you can earn — the more participants you invite, the more rewards you accumulate.<br>
  •	Referral bonuses are <strong>separate from bonus raffle entries</strong>, giving you both <strong>monetary rewards</strong> and <strong>higher chances of winning</strong> in the E-Raffle.</p>

   <h2>PAYOUT</h2>
  <p>• Raffle Prizes: Processing will begin on the same day after the draw is completed.<br>
  • Referral Bonuses: Due to high volumes, processing may take 24 to 72 hours.<br>
  • For the Jackpot and Mega prize winners, we will reach out to ensure they can claim their prize properly, as e-wallet providers set limits based on each participant’s account status.<br>
  • Transfer fees may apply for non-Maya accounts for both Raffle Prizes and Referral Bonuses.</p>
